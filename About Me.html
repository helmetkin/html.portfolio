<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<hr>
<p>Alright enough with the corniness...Hello everyone and anyone  who looks at this /wave.
     My name is Kate M and I am an aspiring Coder/Web developer/Software Engineer. 
     I am US based and currently in the state of North Carolina.
     I have no clue what direction I would like to go towards yet as I have only been working towards this goal as of 8/22/23 for about a week. 
     I'm 32 and I just recently got married last November of 2022 to my beautiful wife Britney, 
     I love technology and learning and so far this is the best thing I have ever done. 
    I'm so excited to see where this opportunity can take me!
